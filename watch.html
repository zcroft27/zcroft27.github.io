# Docker Compose Watch for Live-Reloading in Golang
If you want to orchestrate containers for a full stack application with frontend
and backend containers using Docker, development can be tedious if done incorrectly.

With just Docker Compose and a Dockerfile, upon changing code during testing a developer must manually:
- Bring down the cluster
- Save changes and recompile
- Rebuild the image
- Bring up the cluster

This takes a relatively long time, especially if you are using larger base images and have a
dense program to compile.

Some options could include:
- Volume mounting the backend directory, executing a shell instance in your backend container,
and recompiling + restarting.
- Volume mounting and using a live-reloading library like [fresh](https://github.com/gravityblast/fresh).

The first approach is annoying and the second approach is shortsighted and won't work for frontend.

[Docker Compose Watch](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/file-watch/) solves this issue by watching
for changes in specified directories and then syncing and restarting. This is better than using something like fresh
because this is extensible to frontend, databases, etc., without needing to find a specific hot/live reloading service
for each container.

Here is an example of a docker-compose.yaml file for a full stack application with port mapping,
DNS names for containers, dependencies, Watch, and commands.

```go
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend
    command: npm run dev
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: sync+restart
          path: ./frontend
          target: /app
    networks:
      - app-network


  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    command: go run main.go
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: sync+restart
          path: ./backend
          target: /app
    networks:
      - app-network
    container_name: backend


networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```

## To run
```bash
docker compose up --build --watch 
```
--watch is necessary to enable Watch, otherwise press w after orchestrating!

The Dockerfiles in the backend and frontend would both just compile your program but not execute it--it is
the job of the orchestrator to run the program in this approach.

With this approach, you would develop only using Docker Compose and Watch will notice any changes,
sync,  restart, and execute the specified command "go run main.go" again. This decreases the time
taken to reflect changes from 10-30 seconds manually to < 3 seconds in many cases, drastically
increasing development efficiency. 

Note: After a bit of development with this approach, we came to the conclusion that Docker Compose Watch was a bit slower than the
        npm hot reloading for frontend--this can be solved by removing the 'watch:' property and volume-mounting the frontend, in which case the
        default npm hot-reloading should be in effect.
