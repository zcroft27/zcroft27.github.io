# Route Optimizer
A JavaScript web-app I created in summer 2024 with the goal of helping the IT department I worked for efficiently deploy hardware. I was tasked with driving to ~40 locations
across Massachusetts for some work, and I noticed there were not great free options to plan a route of this size effectively, so I made this program.
      
## Overview
- A traveling-salesman-esque problem, solved with a nearest-neighbors approach utilizing the Google Maps API.
- Autocompletes address input and displays a map widget illustrating planned route.

## What I Learned
This was my first experience with using a web framework (Express.js) and making endpoints. It was also my first time integrating a more complicated API
and utilizing the Google Cloud console. This was a project to dip my toes into web-dev that exposed me to some simple problems requiring solutions like using an .env file,
concurrent/asynchronous programming (and the following debugging pains), and time-efficient programming. With my initial innefficient approach, network latency, and the volume of
comparisons made on a set of 20 locations, for example, Big O became relevant.   

Perhaps a good learning experience: at the end of building this project, I realized that the Google Maps API offers a feature to do route optimizing for you--I was
just using their Distance Matrix API and comparing retrieved distances between locations. This was a little defeating, but ultimately this project was for learning and functionality.
Plus, this showed me the value in computing server-side and reducing network traffic, which later became relevant when optimizing SQL queries to offload computation
to a PostgreSQL RDBMS as a software engineer in Generate.  
      
## Intended Features/TODO
- Implement the ability to plan for multiple-session routes--i.e. given 40 locations and an 8-hour limit per session (returning home after each session), plan the best route.

- Support automatic rest-stops--i.e. pick a window for a lunch break and present options around the location you will be around then.
