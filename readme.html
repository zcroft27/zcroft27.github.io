## What am I Currently Working On?
I am currently developing a distributed file system following the Raft Consensus Protocol in Python, with automatic sub-domain generation using the
Cloudflare API and my domain. I wrote a custom C user-space file system last semester, supporting default file system operations,
large files, and nested directories. 

I have two Raspberry Pis, among several laptops and computers lying around, and have been testing it across devices.
For easier testing, I am using Docker Compose to create a cluster of containers to test on. I also have a
variety of networking switches to practice configuring VLANs, PXE, etc.

## What Courses am I Taking SP25?
CS 4730 Distributed Systems - A previous semester's website can be found [here](https://cnitarot.github.io/courses/ds_Spring_2023/index.html).
I am really excited for this course, because I enjoy systems design and implementation, and I would like to work on distributed
systems throughout my career. Ever since I implemented the Chandy-Lamport Global State Recording Algorithm in CS 2800 Logic and Computation,
I have been fascinated by the problems and solutions within distributed systems.

CS 3000/3001 Algorithms and Data/Recitation - This is particularly fascinating because I like to work on networked applications,
which are inherently relatively slow, so learning how to optimize my code is valuable.

CS 4535 Professional Practicum Capstone - I am a Technical Lead in Generate, and Khoury is newly offering the option
for client-facing members of Generate to take this course for credit. I will be iteratively designing and implementing an
app for a client, regularly checking in with professors and writing reports.

MATH 4570 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis and Machine Learning - I am finishing my mathematics minor with this course. I am interested in utilizing machine learning in my
personal projects, and I have many ideas for projects. I will be utilizing my linear algebra, probability and statistics,
and multivariable calculus skills to learn some practical Python/Tensorflow skills.
