# Arenius
Arenius is a carbon-accounting platform to empower small-to-medium sized businesses to track, manage, and reduce their carbon footprint.

I was a technical lead, alongside technical lead [Dessy Dusichka](https://dessydusichka.com/), design lead Rachel Ma, and product lead Grace Uecker.

We led a team of 5 engineers and 4 designers over the course of one semester to build an app for our client Ned Botherway.

Over this semester, our engineering team planned 100+ tickets, merged 170+ pull requests, and maintained thorough documentation along the way.

## Key Features
Notably, we implemented nightly data syncing from the accounting platform Xero using OAuth and a cron job, a variety of graphs and charts to display data,
and user uthentication and authorization. Additionally, we created a 'reconciliation' process, where users would view their automatically imported
transactions and assign carbon emissions factors, which would be used to calculate carbon footprint. To supplement this process, we created
a separate neural network recommendation service to suggest carbon emissions factors to enhance the user experience.

## What I Learned
As a technical lead, some unique areas of development included planning, scoping, and creating tickets, researching integrations, and reviewing code.
Additionally, we used Golang for our backend, React + Next.js / TypeScript for our frontend, and DigitalOcean for our deployment, which were
great practical learning experiences.
