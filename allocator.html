# Custom Memory Allocator in C
A free-space management system built in C, replacing the built in malloc, calloc, and free. I built this
last semester for CS 3650, and I implemented some extra features like coalescing, splitting, and defragmentation.
I also ensured thread-safety, allowing concurrent processes to allocate/deallocate memory without deadlocks or race issues.

## Why?
What's wrong with stdlib malloc? Well, malloc is like the one-size-fits-all free-space management system.
You often don't use C for one-size-fits-all projects, however, because it's a pain to write. You use it for
time-sensitive, memory-limited, storage-constrained, or otherwise performance-critical projects. Perhaps you don't
care about how long it takes for memory to be allocated each time you make a request, but you *really* don't want random slow downs from
defragmentation during runtime. Or maybe you're working on a project with a very predictable memory allocation pattern, and the
generalized approach of malloc just isn't efficient enough. 

## How it Works
To implement a free-space management system, your program must keep track of pointers to virtual memory. These
pointers then must be labeled as free or allocated. The--deprecated--sbrk system call offers a simple interface
to 'retrieve' memory from your operating system by adjusting your process' heap space.

After getting a pointer to a defined address space from your operating system, you are now the arbiter of memory.
You need to keep track of a pointer to your free-space, as well as the size of the space. Moreover, as you lease memory,
you need to keep track of *all* the pointers to free-space, as well as their corresponding sizes. 
To keep track of free-space--which will be dynamic--you need a dynamic data structure like a linked-list, which necessitates
memory allocation... Wait...

Well, to make do with this situation, you can embed the free-list in the same memory that you are leasing out.

## Implementation
If your program initially retrieves 4KiB from your operating system, you have 4096 bytes to work with.
To keep track of free memory, you need a size and a pointer.
Without revealing my implementation, it is true that a collection of these (in a struct) will take some
memory. If your struct takes 8 bytes, then you could at most lease 4096 - 8 = 4088 bytes. In order for this
design to work simply, your struct for an allocated memory block must also be 8 bytes. When you lease a pointer to memory,
ensure you return a pointer *beyond* the metadata header you create, otherwise you are asking the lessee to
overwrite your metadata.

## Intended Features/TODO
- Experiment with other allocation approaches, such as buddy allocation and best-fit.
- Implement a minimal garbage collection system.
- Allocate separate pools of memory from the OS for each thread using TLS in order to
avoid locking.
