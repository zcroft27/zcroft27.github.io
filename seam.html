# Image Compression and Resizing
You can watch a [video](https://youtu.be/9DEuui1XGyM) of my project in action.

## Overview
- Content aware image compression and resizing using the [seam carving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving)
technique, **optimized to linear time complexity** using dynamic programming.
- You can resize images vertically and/or horizontally. 
- You can toggle between a normal, grayscale, and ‚Äòenergy‚Äô view.
- You can reinsert removed seams from images.
- Verified with 300+ tests.
- Written in Java, it utilizes a graph structure with [deques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-set-1-introduction-applications/) and
[sentinels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value), emphasizing strong object-oriented principles. 

## Purpose
In order to shrink an image, necessarily some data must be compromised. The most straightforward method is to
crop an image, but this is very lossy and must cut out significant features of an image. Another option might
be to blend neighboring pixels together, but this decreases clarity across the entire image.   

This solution calculates the energy* of pixels, and then calculates the minimum cumulative energy of connected (diagonal or touching)
pixels in a specified direction (vertical or horizontal). I utilized dynamic programming to speed up this calculation process,
given that for each pixel in a row, for example, there are 3 candidate pixels, and then 3 for each of those, etc., so 3<sup># rows</sup> comparisons.
Employing dynamic programming can reduce this do linear complexity.

This maintains the most 'important' parts of images, working very effectively. As shown in the linked video,
main features like animals, buildings, and vehicles will typically persist, while sky, roads, and land will be removed.

* Energy calculation:

HorizEnergy(E)=(br(A)+2br(D)+br(G))‚àí(br(C)+2br(F)+br(I))

VertEnergy(E)=(br(A)+2br(B)+br(C))‚àí(br(G)+2br(H)+br(I))

Energy(E)= sqrt(HorizEnergy(E)<sup>2</sup>+VertEnergy(E)<sup>2</sup>)
